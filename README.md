# Evil Briefcase!

This package provides a vim motion to quickly switch between cases. Hate camelCase? SWAP IT!!!

# Usage (spacemacs)

In your .spacemacs file (`SPC f e d`):

```el

dotspacemacs-additional-packages
'(
  (evil-briefcase-mode :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "strickinato/evil-briefcase"))
)

```

Then in the user config later in the file:

```el

(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (evil-briefcase-mode 1)
)

```

### Can be used either as a motion:

`zcE  ` -- Make everything until the whitespace camelcased

`zki( ` -- Make everthing inside the parentheses kebab kase


### Or it can be used in visual mode:

`vi(zk ` -- Select everything in the parentheses visually, then make it kebab kase

# Known Annoyances

This overwrites `evil`'s current `zs`, which is `evil-close-fold`. I never use folding, but if you use code folding and don't rely on toggling, then you'll have to remap it back.

These functions are based of the amazing [s.el](https://github.com/magnars/s.el). This made the package easy to write, but it also means that ceratin non text characters get stripped away. eg.


`[:openTheBriefcase]`, with cursor on the `B`:

```el

  zci[ #=> [open_the_briefcase] (we lose the colon)

```
